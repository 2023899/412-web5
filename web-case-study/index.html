    <h3 class="Abril_Fatface_header2">The Goal</h3>

    <div class="bordertext_about">
    <p class="Oswald-Regular">For this project, I had to make a website for a client's business. For me, I decided to make a website for a Montreal photographer and videographer ShhVelly with his photography and
        videography business named ShhFilmedBy. He mostly do photoshoots of musicians and events and does music videos for a lot of the upcoming Montreal rappers and singers that are coming up in the city's 
        local music scene.

    <div class="column">
    <h3 class="Abril_Fatface_header2">The Process</h3>

    <div class="bordertext_about">
    <p class="Oswald-Regular">ShhVelly reached out to me before in the past so I was well familiar with his works and the music videos that he shot for Montreal artists. I reached out 
        to him on Instagram to make a website for his photography business for a school project and he was down for me to make the website. After he agreed, I sent him a questionnaire for him 
        to fill out so I can have an idea of how he wanted the website to be designed. ShhVelly answered the questionnaire and stated that he wanted a user friendly website and a warm 
        atmosphere for potential clients. ShhVelly wanted the goal of the website to promote his brand ShhFilmedBy and wanted it displayed in the best capacity possible that 
        demonstrates work product and quality. 
    </p>

    <p class="Oswald-Regular">After recieving the answers to the questionnaire, I started working on the website immediately. I started by making a wireframe sketch of how the website was going to look 
        and I designed the prototype version of the wireframe in Adobe XD. I applied what the client wanted to for the website and his preferred colors. </p>
        
    <p class="Oswald-Regular">After setting my game plan of how I was 
        going to tackle this website, I started the website by designing the homepage where I designed the header elements (links to other pages, logo to redirect to homepage, banner) and the body 
        elements such as the name of the website, the header, the images, the color of the overall page, etc. I then worked on each page and added the styling that would give off a warm 
        atmosphere and environment. I then worked on the interview and music video pages where I display the interviews and music videos that the client shot.

        <h3 class="Abril_Fatface_header2">The Overall Experince</h3>

        <p class="Oswald-Regular">I had an overall good experience where designing the website for the client was concerned. The thing I enjoyed about 
            working on this project, is implementing the knowledge I gamined from my experience in web class in the Micromedia (graphic design course) and 
            the css to make the entire website look unique and memorable to the client's customers by implementing elements such as the dark mode, the simple colors, the fonts. 
            The thing that took me the most time where this project was concerned that I struggled at first was making everything look organized with the text margins, making the website 
            mobile responsive with the elements I added to the pages, having the rows and columns well organzied and structured with no gaps because there were gaps when I first added the 
            rows and columns not in the proper way that they should have been.
